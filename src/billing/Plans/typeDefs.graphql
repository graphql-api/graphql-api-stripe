  Specifies a usage aggregation strategy for plans of `usage_type=metered`.
  Allowed values are `sum` for summing up all usage during a period,
  `last_during_period` for picking the last usage record reported within a
  period, `last_ever` for picking the last usage record ever (across period
  bounds) or `max` which picks the usage record with the maximum reported usage
  during a period. Defaults to `sum`.

  Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit` or `tiered`.
  `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in `amount`) will be
  charged per unit in `quantity` (for plans with `usage_type=licensed`), or per
  unit of total usage (for plans with `usage_type=metered`). `tiered` indicates
  that the unit pricing will be computed using a tiering strategy as defined
  using the `tiers` and `tiers_mode` attributes.
