  metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the
  subscription moves into an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid
  within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is
  a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.

  A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over.

  If subscription `billing=charge_automatically` it becomes `past_due` when
  payment to renew it fails and `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your
  subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts.

  If subscription `billing=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice
  is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not
  paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a
  status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be
  created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated
  payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their
  closed invoices.
