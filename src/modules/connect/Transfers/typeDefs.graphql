"""
A Transfer object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.

Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a Payout object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the transfer/payout split.
