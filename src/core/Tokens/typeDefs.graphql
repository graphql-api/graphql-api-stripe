"""
Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. You should use Checkout, Elements, or our mobile libraries to perform this process, client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.

Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, you can create Customer objects or Custom accounts. Note that Radar, our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, supports only integrations that use client-side tokenization.
